Code Review
Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

Use of Syntax: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML validation and CSS validation tests.

IMPORTANT: Please read the Instructor Notes below for further instructions on HTML validation. 

Use of Logical HTML Structure: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a <div> or <span>). Additionally, all tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a <p> tag to make a headline).
Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class name.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include a CSS file in your project submissions. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using <style> tags is not sufficient enough to demonstrate your knowledge of linking CSS to your HTML file.
Use of Tags: Page uses tags correctly. <p> for paragraphs. <h1> for main heading, etc.
Content Display: Page display at least 1 image and some text.
